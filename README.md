# Reflection
A Reflection on Creating My Personal Portfolio Creating my personal portfolio website has been a meaningful project that allowed me to apply the skills I have learned in web development. Through this project, I was able to combine HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript to design and showcase my identity as an aspiring IT student and future web developer. It served as a platform where I could introduce myself, highlight my skills, and present the projects I have worked on. One of the key lessons I gained was the importance of creating a clean and user-friendly interface. I realized that good design is not only about colors and layouts, but also about readability, simplicity, and navigation. In building this portfolio, I also practiced responsive design, ensuring that the website adjusts
well on different devices. This experience taught me how crucial it is to make websites accessible and functional for various users. Moreover, using GitHub Pages to host my project gave me exposure to version control and deployment, which are valuable tools for real-world
development. Overall, this project was not only a technical exercise but also a way to express my goals and passion in IT. It motivated me to keep improving my skills and work towards becoming a professional web developer.
